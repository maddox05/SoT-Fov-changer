# SoT-Fov-changer
A Sea of thieves FOV changer, I made this to work on reverse engineering and learning more about Pymem's remote-pointer. 
It works for the microsoft store version, and if you want it to work for steam you will need to update the pointers accordingly.
This will most likely break after every update.
